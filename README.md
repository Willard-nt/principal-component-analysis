# Data Analyst

### Principal Component Analysis

#### Objective
This comprehensive data science project demonstrates advanced data preprocessing and analytical preparation skills through a complete data cleaning workflow. The project involves selecting a raw industry dataset and systematically transforming it into an analysis-ready format by identifying and resolving data quality issues, implementing missing data imputation techniques, and detecting statistical outliers through advanced visualization and analytical methods. The project showcases end-to-end data preparation capabilities, beginning with the formulation of a strategic research question that addresses real-world organizational challenges. Through the implementation of a structured data cleaning methodology using Python or R, the project documents comprehensive findings about data quality issues and applies evidence-based remediation techniques. The workflow culminates with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, delivering a clean, optimized dataset accompanied by detailed documentation including annotated code, statistical visualizations, and critical evaluation of methodological limitations that inform subsequent analytical decision-making.
